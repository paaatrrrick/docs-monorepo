## Selection and storage tips

Get the most out of your fruits with these guidelines:

### Choosing fresh fruit

- **Look for vibrant colors**: Bright, consistent coloring usually indicates ripeness
- **Check for firmness**: Fruits should be firm but give slightly when pressed
- **Smell the fruit**: A sweet, fruity aroma often means it's ripe and ready
- **Avoid bruises**: Soft spots and bruises can indicate overripeness or damage

### Storage methods

Different fruits have different storage requirements:

```plaintext
Refrigerate immediately:
- Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
- Grapes
- Cherries
- Cut or peeled fruit

Room temperature until ripe, then refrigerate:
- Avocados
- Peaches
- Pears
- Plums
- Nectarines

Store at room temperature:
- Apples (for up to 7 days)
- Bananas
- Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes)
- Melons (until cut)
```

<Tip>
  Store bananas separately from other fruits. They release ethylene gas that can cause other fruits to ripen too quickly.
</Tip>

## Incorporating fruits into your diet

### Daily recommendations

The USDA recommends 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day for adults. Here's what that looks like:

- 1 cup = 1 large banana or orange
- 1 cup = 8 large strawberries
- 1 cup = 32 grapes
- 1/2 cup = 1 medium apple

## Seasonal fruit guide

Eating fruits in season ensures the best flavor and nutritional value:

| Season | Fruits |
|--------|--------|
| Spring | Strawberries, apricots, cherries, pineapples |
| Summer | Watermelon, peaches, plums, berries, mangoes |
| Fall | Apples, pears, grapes, figs, pomegranates |
