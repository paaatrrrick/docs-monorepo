## Overview

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The disaster resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.

## Construction

The Titanic was built by Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland between 1909 and 1912. At the time of her launch, she was the largest ship afloat.

### Key specifications

- **Length**: 882 feet 9 inches (269.1 m)
- **Width**: 92 feet 6 inches (28.2 m)
- **Height**: 175 feet (53.3 m) from keel to top of funnels
- **Gross tonnage**: 46,328 tons
- **Capacity**: 2,435 passengers and 892 crew members

The ship featured luxurious accommodations, including a swimming pool, gymnasium, squash court, and opulent first-class cabins.

## The maiden voyage

The Titanic departed Southampton on April 10, 1912, with stops in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, before heading across the Atlantic.

### Timeline

- **April 10**: Departed Southampton at noon
- **April 10**: Arrived in Cherbourg, France at 6:30 PM
- **April 11**: Stopped in Queenstown, Ireland at 11:30 AM
- **April 14**: Received ice warnings throughout the day
- **April 14, 11:40 PM**: Struck an iceberg on the starboard side
- **April 15, 2:20 AM**: Sank beneath the waves

## The sinking

On the night of April 14, 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 PM ship's time. The collision opened the ship's hull to the sea, causing six of the sixteen watertight compartments to flood.

### Critical factors

- **Insufficient lifeboats**: Only 20 lifeboats for over 2,200 people aboard
- **Speed**: Ship was traveling at near maximum speed despite ice warnings
- **Temperature**: Water temperature was approximately 28°F (-2°C)
- **Response time**: Nearby ship Californian did not respond to distress signals

The ship broke apart and sank at 2:20 AM on April 15, 1912. Of the estimated 2,224 people aboard, more than 1,500 died.

## Rescue and aftermath

The RMS Carpathia arrived at approximately 4:00 AM and rescued 710 survivors from the lifeboats. The disaster led to significant changes in maritime safety regulations.

### Legacy and impact

- Establishment of the International Ice Patrol to monitor icebergs
- Implementation of 24-hour radio watch on passenger ships
- Requirement for sufficient lifeboats for all passengers and crew
- International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in 1914

## Discovery

The wreck of the Titanic was discovered on September 1, 1985, by a joint American-French expedition led by Robert Ballard. The ship lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 m) in two main pieces about 2,000 feet (600 m) apart.

The wreck site is now protected as a maritime memorial and is slowly deteriorating due to metal-eating bacteria and ocean currents.
